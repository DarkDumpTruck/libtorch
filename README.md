# libsnake

`Libsnake` is a library designed to solve a unique problem: finding the longest possible 'snake' within a grid field. In this context, a 'snake' is defined as a simple path that traverses through the grid, visiting each node only once. This library provides a set of algorithms to efficiently identify these paths, making it a valuable tool for tasks involving grid-based pathfinding and optimization.
